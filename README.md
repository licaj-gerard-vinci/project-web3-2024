    <h2>Pros of Firebase</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Real-time Database: Firebase's Firestore and Realtime Database provide real-time syncing of data between the app and the server, making it ideal for applications that require live updates.</li>
<li>Easy Integration: Firebase has built-in SDKs and easy integration with web, iOS, and Android platforms. It's particularly friendly for developers using React, Vue.js, and other frameworks.</li>
<li>Authentication: Firebase offers a robust authentication system that supports sign-in with Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more, along with custom authentication mechanisms.</li>
<li>Serverless Backend: No need to manage servers. Firebase automatically scales with your app, and services like Firebase Functions provide serverless compute options.</li>
<li>Hosting: Firebase provides fast and reliable web hosting with a built-in content delivery network (CDN), making it a great option for deploying web applications.</li>

  <h2>Cons of Firebase</h2>
<li>Cost: While the free tier is useful for small apps, Firebase's pricing can escalate quickly as your app grows in terms of storage, real-time database reads/writes, and bandwidth usage.</li>
<li>Limited Queries: Firebase‚Äôs NoSQL databases (Firestore and Realtime Database) have limitations when it comes to complex querying. Developers may find it challenging to perform advanced queries without restructuring data.</li>
<li>Vendor Lock-in: Firebase is a proprietary Google service, meaning that once your app is built around Firebase services, it can be difficult to migrate to other platforms without a significant rewrite.</li>
<li>Limited Relational Data Support: Firebase is a NoSQL database, and while it supports hierarchical data, it lacks strong relational database capabilities like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).</li>
<li>Not Suitable for Every Project: For complex, enterprise-level projects, developers may find Firebase lacking compared to more flexible, traditional backend solutions.</li>
