    <h2>Pros of Firebase</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time Database:</strong> Firebase's Firestore and Realtime Database provide real-time syncing of data between the app and the server, making it ideal for applications that require live updates.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Easy Integration:</strong> Firebase has built-in SDKs and easy integration with web, iOS, and Android platforms. It's particularly friendly for developers using React, Vue.js, and other frameworks.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Firebase offers a robust authentication system that supports sign-in with Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more, along with custom authentication mechanisms.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Free Tier Available:</strong> Firebase offers a generous free tier, especially for small applications or prototypes. This includes a free quota for Firestore, Hosting, and Authentication.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Serverless Backend:</strong> No need to manage servers. Firebase automatically scales with your app, and services like Firebase Functions provide serverless compute options.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Firebase provides fast and reliable web hosting with a built-in content delivery network (CDN), making it a great option for deploying web applications.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Analytics Integration:</strong> Firebase integrates seamlessly with Google Analytics, providing powerful insights into user behavior, retention, and more.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Cross-Platform Support:</strong> Firebase supports cross-platform development, which makes it easier to build apps that work on Android, iOS, and the web with a single backend.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cons of Firebase</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> While the free tier is useful for small apps, Firebase's pricing can escalate quickly as your app grows in terms of storage, real-time database reads/writes, and bandwidth usage.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Limited Queries:</strong> Firebase‚Äôs NoSQL databases (Firestore and Realtime Database) have limitations when it comes to complex querying. Developers may find it challenging to perform advanced queries without restructuring data.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Vendor Lock-in:</strong> Firebase is a proprietary Google service, meaning that once your app is built around Firebase services, it can be difficult to migrate to other platforms without a significant rewrite.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Limited Relational Data Support:</strong> Firebase is a NoSQL database, and while it supports hierarchical data, it lacks strong relational database capabilities like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> Since Firebase is a Google product, some developers might have concerns about data privacy and how Google handles user data, especially in highly regulated industries.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Cold Start Latency:</strong> Firebase Functions, being serverless, can experience cold start issues, which means the first request might be slow if the function hasn't been invoked recently.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Not Suitable for Every Project:</strong> For complex, enterprise-level projects, developers may find Firebase lacking compared to more flexible, traditional backend solutions.</li>
  </ul>
